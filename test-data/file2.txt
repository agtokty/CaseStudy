The call to MyIteratorMethod doesn't execute the body of the method. Instead the call returns an IEnumerable<string> 
into the elements variable.

On an iteration of the foreach loop, the MoveNext method is called for elements. This call executes the body of MyIteratorMethod 
until the next yield return statement is reached. The expression returned by the yield return statement determines not only the value of the element variable for 
consumption by the loop body but also the Current property of elements, which is an IEnumerable<string>.

On each subsequent iteration of the foreach loop, the execution of the iterator body continues from where it 
left off, again stopping when it reaches a yield return statement. The foreach loop completes when the end of the 
iterator method or a yield break statement is reached.
